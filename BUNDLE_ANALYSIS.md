# Frontend Bundle Size Analysis with Vite

To analyze the JavaScript bundle size of the Vite-based frontend application and identify potential areas for optimization, you can use the `rollup-plugin-visualizer`.

## Steps:

1.  **Install `rollup-plugin-visualizer`:**
    If not already installed, add it as a development dependency:
    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev rollup-plugin-visualizer
    # or
    yarn add --dev rollup-plugin-visualizer
    # or
    pnpm add --save-dev rollup-plugin-visualizer
    ```

2.  **Configure Vite:**
    Modify your `vite.config.ts` (or `vite.config.js`) file to include the visualizer plugin.

    ```typescript
    // vite.config.ts
    import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
    import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'; // or your specific framework plugin
    import { visualizer } from 'rollup-plugin-visualizer';

    export default defineConfig({
      plugins: [
        react(), // your existing framework plugin
        // Add the visualizer plugin
        visualizer({
          open: true, // Automatically open the report in your browser after build
          filename: 'stats.html', // Output HTML file name
          gzipSize: true, // Show Gzipped size
          brotliSize: true, // Show Brotli compressed size (if applicable)
        }),
        // ... other plugins
      ],
      // ... other Vite configurations
    });
    ```

3.  **Build the Application:**
    Run your production build command:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    yarn build
    # or
    pnpm build
    ```

4.  **Analyze the Report:**
    *   After the build process completes, an HTML file named `stats.html` (or the filename you configured) will be generated in your project's root directory (or sometimes in the `dist` folder, check plugin options if needed).
    *   If `open: true` was set, this file will automatically open in your default web browser.
    *   The report displays a **treemap visualization** of your bundle. Each rectangle represents a module or chunk, and its size is proportional to its contribution to the overall bundle size.
    *   You can interact with the treemap to see details of specific modules, their sizes (original, Gzipped, Brotli), and their paths.

5.  **Identify Optimization Opportunities:**
    *   **Large Dependencies:** Look for unexpectedly large third-party libraries. Consider if they are essential, if smaller alternatives exist, or if parts of them can be imported selectively (tree-shaking).
    *   **Code Duplication:** The visualizer can sometimes help spot if the same code is being included in multiple chunks.
    *   **Large Chunks:** Identify if any particular code-split chunks are excessively large. This might indicate a need to further split these chunks or optimize the code within them.
    *   **Unused Code:** While Vite handles tree-shaking well, the visualizer can sometimes give clues if large portions of a library are included that you don't expect to be using.

By regularly analyzing your bundle, you can proactively manage its size and ensure a faster loading experience for your users.
