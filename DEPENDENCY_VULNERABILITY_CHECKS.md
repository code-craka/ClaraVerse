# Dependency Vulnerability Check Process

Regularly checking for vulnerabilities in project dependencies is crucial for maintaining application security. Here's how to perform these checks for both the Node.js/Frontend and Python backend:

## Node.js / Frontend Dependencies

For projects managed with npm (or yarn/pnpm, which have similar commands):

1.  **Check for Vulnerabilities:**
    The `npm audit` command analyzes your project's dependencies and produces a report of known vulnerabilities.
    ```bash
    npm audit
    ```
    This command will show a summary of vulnerabilities, including their severity (low, moderate, high, critical) and affected packages.

2.  **Attempt Automatic Fixes:**
    For many vulnerabilities, npm can attempt to automatically update to a patched version of the dependency.
    ```bash
    npm audit fix
    ```
    Sometimes, a full fix requires a breaking change. In such cases, you might need to use `npm audit fix --force`, but be cautious as this can break your application. Review changes carefully.

3.  **Check for Outdated Packages:**
    Keeping packages up-to-date is a good preventative measure, as newer versions often include security patches and improvements.
    ```bash
    npm outdated
    ```
    This command lists packages that have newer versions available. You can then update them using `npm update <package_name>` or by modifying your `package.json` and running `npm install`.

## Python Backend Dependencies

For Python projects, you can use tools like `pip-audit` or `safety`.

**Using `pip-audit`:**

1.  **Install `pip-audit`:**
    ```bash
    pip install pip-audit
    ```

2.  **Run Audit:**
    `pip-audit` checks your currently installed environment or can check a `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    # Audit the current environment
    pip-audit

    # Audit a requirements file
    pip-audit -r requirements.txt
    ```

**Using `safety`:**

1.  **Install `safety`:**
    ```bash
    pip install safety
    ```

2.  **Run Audit:**
    `safety` typically checks against a `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    # Generate a requirements.txt if you don't have one
    # pip freeze > requirements.txt

    safety check -r requirements.txt
    ```
    `safety` uses the Safety DB, which is a curated database of Python vulnerabilities.

## Recommendations

*   **Regular Scans:** Perform these checks regularly, such as weekly or bi-weekly.
*   **CI/CD Integration:** Integrate these vulnerability checks into your Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. This ensures that vulnerabilities are caught automatically before deployment.
*   **Review Vulnerabilities:** Don't just blindly apply fixes. Understand the vulnerability and the potential impact of the fix.
*   **Stay Informed:** Subscribe to security mailing lists or feeds for your key dependencies to be aware of newly discovered vulnerabilities.
*   **Update Dependencies:** Regularly update your dependencies to their latest non-breaking versions, even if no vulnerabilities are reported for the versions you are currently using. This proactively reduces the chances of using a vulnerable version.
